## Session Purposes

Each session stays focused on what you need right now. The purpose persists throughout the entire conversation.

| Purpose | What you get |
|---------|-------------|
| **Brainstorming** | Think through architecture before writing a line of code. Get multiple approaches with tradeoffs so you pick the right one. |
| **Development** | Ship features with clean, tested code that follows your existing patterns. Small changes, verified one at a time. |
| **Code Review** | Catch bugs, security holes, and edge cases before they reach production. Specific feedback with file and line references. |
| **PR Review** | Review pull requests end-to-end before merging. Clear summary of what changed, what's good, and what needs work. |
| **Debugging** | Find the root cause, not a band-aid. Reproduces the issue, traces it methodically, and verifies the fix actually works. |

## Features

**Parallel sessions, zero conflicts** — Run multiple sessions on the same project. Each one is automatically isolated so they don't overwrite each other's work.

**Embedded terminal** — Full interactive terminal built in. Colors, scrollback, resize. Switch between sessions instantly without re-spawning Claude.

**~7MB, low resource usage** — Built with Rust and Tauri. No Electron, no bundled Chromium. Starts fast, stays light.

**Organized by project** — Sessions grouped by project folder with expand/collapse. Auto-discovers your existing Claude Code sessions.

**Usage tracking** — Session and weekly usage limits visible in the menu bar. Know how much headroom you have without leaving the app.

**Themes and shortcuts** — Dark/light themes, accent colors. `Cmd+N` new session, `Cmd+1-9` switch, `Cmd+B` toggle sidebar.
