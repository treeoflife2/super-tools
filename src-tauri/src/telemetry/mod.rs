#![allow(dead_code)] // LOCAL FORK: scheduler is neutralized in scheduler::spawn,
                      // which leaves payload assembly + restore() helpers unused.
                      // Keeping them compiled (just not called) so upstream merges
                      // touch zero lines outside scheduler.rs's spawn().

// Telemetry — append-only daily heartbeats.
//
// Design rules (the user signed off explicitly):
//   • Zero app impact. Hot path is `bump(key)` — a single atomic add on
//     a globally-shared `OnceCell<HashMap<&'static str, AtomicU64>>`.
//     No locks, no allocations, no I/O. Order is Relaxed because we're
//     counting, not synchronising with anything.
//   • Counters never accumulate beyond one 24h window. The scheduler
//     atomically swaps to 0 at flush time. If the POST fails the value
//     is lost; we don't retry. The next 24h window covers the gap.
//   • Counts are bucketed BEFORE leaving the device — wire format
//     never contains raw integers. Privacy guarantee at the source.
//   • No raw text fields. URLs, hosts, file paths, query bodies,
//     command lines, error messages — none of it lives in this module.
//   • Opt-out via `settings.telemetry_optout = "true"`. When opted out,
//     the scheduler skips the POST entirely and resets counters.
//
// Two cohorts share the same payload shape: when the user is logged in
// the bearer token is attached and the worker writes `user_id`; when
// they're not, the row lands as anonymous (NULL user_id). The local
// `device_id` is stable across login state — it's tied to the install,
// not the account.
