//! Centralised `reqwest::Client` construction.
//!
//! Two builders, both backed by user settings stored in the `settings` table:
//!
//! - `build_app_http_client(pool)` — applies the global proxy setting and
//!   nothing else. All non-REST outbound traffic (AI providers, GitHub
//!   OAuth + Gist sync, the updater, ClickHouse HTTP, agent usage analytics)
//!   should go through this so corporate-network users behind a mandatory
//!   proxy can reach those services.
//!
//! - `build_rest_http_client(pool)` — extends the app client with REST-only
//!   knobs: `request_timeout`, `follow_redirects`, `ssl_verification`. The
//!   `max_response_size` setting is enforced separately in the executor
//!   (reqwest doesn't have a per-request body cap).
//!
//! All settings have safe fallbacks; missing or unparsable values fall back
//! to the documented defaults rather than failing the build.
//!
//! `ssl_verification` defaults to `true` — this is the safe default. The
//! UI exposes a toggle to flip it OFF (with a clear retry-on-cert-error
//! flow on the frontend), which then passes through as
//! `danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)` to reqwest. Previously this flag
//! was unconditionally hardcoded `true` (= verify OFF), which was wrong.
//!
//! Errors are bubbled up rather than swallowed: if `proxy_url` is malformed
//! the whole client build fails so the user sees a real error instead of
//! silent fallback.
